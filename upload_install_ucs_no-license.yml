#      description: This playbook will either
#      upload, upload and install, upload and install without the license
#      upload, install no license, no platform check or delete a .ucs file. 
#      Set the vars accordingly and uncomment the play you want to execute.
#      The ucs needs to be in the /tmp directory of your Ansible host.
#      This ofcourse can be changed down below.
