#      description: This playbook will run a qkview on the systems 
#      defined as [loadbalancer] in the /etc/ansible/hosts file.
#      It will then upload the qkview to dropbox.f5.com. 
#      You need to replace the variables below with your case
#      number and email address used when opening the case. 
#      It will then delete all qkviews on the target loadbalancer. 
#      The F5 devices must have internet access for the upload to dropbox 
#      to work.
