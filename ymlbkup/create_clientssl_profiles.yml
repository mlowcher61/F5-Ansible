#      description: This playbook will create a clientssl profiles. It takes the clientssl
#      profile name, certificate and key from the .csv located in ./files/
#      You must first use the push_cert_key playbook to push the PEM certificate and key
#      files to the desired F5 first. You can create multiple clientssl profiles at once
#      by creating a new row in the .csv file and setting the "primary" column to "yes"
