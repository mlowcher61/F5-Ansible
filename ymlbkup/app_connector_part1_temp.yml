#      description: This playbook will perform the first part of setting up the
#      application connector service center. 
#      The steps are as follows:
#      - Verify that the target F5 device is running v13 or greater
#      - Verify that the F5 device is licensed for App Connector.
#      - Provision all desired modules including iRulesLX. This playbook will
#        provision iRulesLX if you are running Ansible 2.4 and you uncomment 
#        the provisioning module below.
#      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#      You must provision iRulesLX before running this playbook. The module
#      that performs this function will not work until Ansible 2.4 is released
#      I've left the code in and commented it out for later.
#      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
#      - This playbook will enable App Connector.
#      - This playbook will copy the necessary files to the F5
#        NOTICE: Be sure you have staged the files in the ~/ansible/playbooks
#        directory as described in the "Ansible Orchestration for Application
#        Connector deployment guide located at https://github.com/mlowcher61
#      - After running this playbook perform the manual steps described in the 
#        deployment guide prior to running the app_connector_part2 playbook.
