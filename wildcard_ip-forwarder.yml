#      description: This playbook will create a wildcard IP-forwarding vip.
#      If snatting is not required change "automap" to "none"
#      By default the forwarding vip will listen for traffic on all vlans.
#      If you wish to only listen on specific vlans add the following to the "body" line.
#      "vlans": ["/Common/<desired vlan name>"]
