#      description: This playbook will read a CSV file for variables and create a GTM pool. This playbook assumes that vlans and self-ips are already in place. Listeners, datacenters and server objects must also already be configured. If gslb will be configured on the standby unit as well, uncomment the config-sync session at the bottom of this playbook.
