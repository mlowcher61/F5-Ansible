#      short_description: This playbook will add allowed urls
#      to an ASM policy. 
#      The api call cannot use the actual name of the policy.
#      Do the following curl command piped to jq from the CLI of the F5.
#      curl -sku admin:admin https://<ip address of F5 management>/mgmt/tm/asm/policies | jq .items 
#      Match your desired policy name with the long string needed for the api call
#      See the UOBxa66WFloQwonbHg3Rlw example below.
