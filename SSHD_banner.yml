#      description: This playbook will set a banner that is presented upon
#      login. The "inactivity_timeout" can limit the session to X number of seconds. 
#      "allow" can limit ssh access to specific ips or ip ranges.
#      EXAMPLE:
#      ip address such as: 30.20.10.5
#      ip range such as: 172.27.*.* or 172.27.0.0/255.255.0.0
#      but are there to show how to add them if desired.
#      banner: "disabled" will remove the banner.
