#      description: This playbook will reboot a loadbalancer.
#      It will look in your /etc/ansible/hosts file and reboot loadbalancers 
#      defined under [loadbalancer] If you call loadbalancer by itself 
#      it will reboot ALL loadbalancers defined. If you change hosts below 
#      to loadbalancer[0] it will reboot the first loadbalancer in the list.
#      loadbalancer[2] would reboot the third loadbalancer in the list.
