#      description: This playbook will create a child tcp monitor based on the
#      the parent monitor stated in the "type" attribute. The "state" attribute 
#      should be set to "present" to create the monitor and to "absent" to delet
#      the monitor. The "send" and "receive" attributes have been commented out
#      but are there to show how to add them if desired.
