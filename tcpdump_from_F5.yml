#      description: This playbook will execute a tcpdump capture on a remote F5  
#      for the desired amount of time. It will then stop the capture, compress it,
#      bring it down to your Ansible machine and delete the capture from the 
#      remote F5.
#      Set the "time" variable for the number of seconds you want to run the capture.
#      If you select greater than 60 seconds, then change the "pause: minutes"
#      accordingly.
